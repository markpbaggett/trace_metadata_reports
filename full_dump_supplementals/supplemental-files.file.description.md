276. Question 10: How do you feel about the future?
277. Question 11: You talked a little bit about the future if you had to predict 5 years and 10 years where do you think UT Knoxville campus will be with LGBT issues? What will be going on?
278. Question 12: What would you say to someone who asks why it is important to include LGBT in the definition of diversity and why that matters on campus?
279. Question 13: Do you have anything else to add?
280. Question 1: Could you tell us a story about being LGBT on the UTK campus?
281. Question 2: So thinking back to 95 and that time how did you perceive the wider campus community?
282. Question 3: So talk a little about the Commission for LGBT people.
283. Question 4: You have commented on some of the achievements of the commission, could you tell us a little about its purpose?
284. Question 5: So it seems that in recent years things have been changing. How do you feel about the general campus environment now and where it's heading?
285. Question 6: In what ways do you see UT Knoxville as being different from or similar to other universities you have had experience with in relation to LGBT issues?
286. Question 7: What would you like your peers or colleagues to know about how it feels to be LGBT on the UTK campus?
287. Question 8: Is there anything you want your peers and colleagues to know about you more personally, you as a person?
288. Question 9: You mention the issue of being invisible on campus. Thinking back to many years was there a way for LGBT people on campus to find each other or to know what struggles they might have been having with discrimination?
289. Photograph of Jenny Moshak
290. Question 10: What would you like your peers/colleagues to know about what it is like to be gay on this campus?
291. Question 11: What would you say to someone who questioned why LGBT issues had to be included in the definition of diversity?
292. Question 12: Is there anything you would want people to know about you personally, other than your identification as a lesbian?
293. Question 13: Is there anything else you would like to tell us about LGBT issues at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville?
294. Question 14: If you were able to look into the future, where would you see this Knoxville campus, related to LGBT issues, say in 10 or 20 years? Or what would you hope it would look like?
295. Question 15: Is there anything else you would like to add?
296. Question 1: Tell us a little bit about yourself, your position, and your experience here at UT.

300. Question 4: How do you feel about this campus' inclusion in the past and now? Has it changed?
301. Question 5: You mentioned you had been here for nineteen years. Tell us a little bit about how things were in those early years as far as networking. What was being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender on campus like back then? Where there outlets or networking?
302. Question 6: You were talking earlier about the student population that you work with. I would be curious as to your observations of if there is a difference in the student population that you work with as far as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender issues, as opposed to the student population in general?
303. Question 7: Have you experienced any discrimination on campus or known of students or others who have?
304. Question 8: Talk about your role as an out mentor to students. What impact do out administrators, faculty, and staff have on students?
