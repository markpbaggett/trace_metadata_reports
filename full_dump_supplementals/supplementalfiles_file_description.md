476. Question 10: How do you feel about the future?
477. Question 11: You talked a little bit about the future if you had to predict 5 years and 10 years where do you think UT Knoxville campus will be with LGBT issues? What will be going on?
478. Question 12: What would you say to someone who asks why it is important to include LGBT in the definition of diversity and why that matters on campus?
479. Question 13: Do you have anything else to add?
480. Question 1: Could you tell us a story about being LGBT on the UTK campus?
481. Question 2: So thinking back to 95 and that time how did you perceive the wider campus community?
482. Question 3: So talk a little about the Commission for LGBT people.
